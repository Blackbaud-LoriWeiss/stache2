# Contributing

We highly encourage contributions from all Stache 2 users. Stache 2 components extend SKY UX 2 capabilities for documentation, so we just ask that you follow the SKY UX 2 coding conventions in the existing code and that you write the appropriate documentation and unit tests for your feature.

For information about working with SKY UX 2, see the [SKY UX 2 README](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/blob/master/README.md). And for more information about how to contribute, see the [SKY UX 2 contribution guidelines](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
